Title:Automated Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

Libraries Used:Tensorflow,Keras,Numpy,Matplotlib,Scikit-learn

Description:Automated plant disease detection refers to the process of using technology, particularly machine learning and computer vision techniques, to identify and diagnose diseases affecting plants. 
This approach aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of disease detection in crops, thereby enabling early intervention and mitigation measures to prevent yield losses and ensure food security.
